• The hands-on project is a lightbox (slideshow) web app

• A web app is built on four foundations:

• HTML code—provides the app's container

• CSS code—defines the app's appearance

• JavaScript code—manages the operation of and output from the app

• Data (usually stored outside the app)

• These components may be developed and maintained by different individuals or teams
